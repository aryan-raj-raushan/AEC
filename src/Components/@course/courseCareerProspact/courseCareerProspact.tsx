In the preceding year, the JEE Advanced Cut off for Common Rank List (CRL) stood at 23.89% in aggregate and 6.83% in each subject. Meanwhile, the JEE Advanced Cut off for Other Backward Classes (OBC) was 21.50% in aggregate and 6.15% in each subject. JoSAA will announce the IIT JEE Cut off ranks on the official website â€“ josaa.admissions.nic.in, coinciding with the JEE Advanced qualifying percentiles. These cut off ranks specify the minimum ranks required by candidates for securing admission to the IITs. Attaining a score of 80 or more is considered commendable in JEE Advanced 2024. However, aspiring for an All India Rank (AIR) 1 necessitates aiming for a score exceeding 320 marks in IIT JEE. In the previous year (2023), the JEE Advanced Cut off for IIT Bombay was 67 for Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), 481 for Electrical Engineering, 1736 for Mechanical Engineering, and 4371 for Civil Engineering. Based on the data from the previous year, students aiming for a rank below 1000 should target a score of 170 marks or higher.`}

						{`Effective JEE Advanced preparation does not necessitate spending 14-18 hours daily; the emphasis should be on the quality and quantity of the syllabus covered rather than the hours invested. The goal is to attain a clear understanding of all subjects instead of rote memorization. Mere aspirations without action are futile; focus on the need for achievement and the necessary steps to attain success. Here are systematic tips on clearing JEE Advanced: Self-Study Pursue dreams with dedication, patience, and persistence. Self-study demands the ability to grasp concepts independently. It is crucial for JEE Advanced candidates to stay resilient when faced with challenges. Differentiate between tuition and self-study time. Set a Calendar and Gather Proper Study Materials Create a timetable and events calendar. Focus on the NCERT syllabus, and use top-quality books for JEE exams (HC Verma for Physics Theory, Arihant, DC Pandey, MS Chauhan for Chemistry). Avoid experimenting with multiple references; complete one book before exploring others. Secure Quality Paper Analysis and Conceptual Test Series Mock tests, especially those resembling previous years' questions, are invaluable. Analyze marking patterns, question types, and exam patterns. Concentrate on areas crucial for paper analysis and address weak points. Give High Priority to Chemistry For organic chemistry, understand the mechanisms of chemical reactions. Cover each topic in inorganic chemistry, and take notes from NCERT books. Create formulas side by side with notes. Solve Lots of Mathematics Constant practice and comprehensive revision of all chapters are essential. Solve multiple questions from previous years' papers and refer to JEE Exemplars and books like Arihant. Take as many mock tests as possible. Pay More Importance to Physics Formulae Practice derivations and formulas for physics. Take test series and mock trials, and solve previous years' questions. Allocate more time to physics, as the approach differs from chemistry and biology. Examine the Previous Year's Paper Analysis Refer to exam analysis to understand subject areas highlighted more. Physics and Mathematics may be slightly tougher, so allocate more time for these sections. Chemistry questions often align with the NCERT syllabus. Create a Self-Made Timetable Break your daily routine into flexible segments. Assign specific times for physics, chemistry, and mathematics to cover all subjects in a day and facilitate revision.`}
